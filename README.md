# Halloween Rock

Fun side project for Javier's Halloween party.

Javier is a bass player, and is organizing a Halloween party. He wants each attendee to bring a meme, printed. My idea is to bring a QR code. To what? A small online game developed here. The game shows a doodle of a drum player, with Javier's face, and the user can make him play drums by clicking on the screen. Each click plays a drum sound, and gives you a coin. You can use the coins to buy more pieces of the drum set, until you have the full set and can play a full drum kit.

## Visuals

The app is designed vertically, to be used on mobile phones.

Central elements:

- The drum player doodle.
- Javier's face, cut from a photo. The face changes expression when the user clicks.
- Drum pieces that can be bought with coins.
- Background with Halloween theme.

Bottom elements:

- Play buttons. You start with a basic drum, and can buy more pieces.

Top elements:

- Coin counter to the left.
- Shop button to the right, to open the shop modal.

Shop modal:

- Shows the available drum pieces to buy.
- Each piece shows its price in coins.
- Already bought pieces are marked as owned and greyed out.
- There are also hats that can be bought to customize Javier's look.
- There are also memes that can be bought to add into the background.
